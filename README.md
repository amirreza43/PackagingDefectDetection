# Packaging Defect Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a binary classification model to predict if a product is intact or damaged. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle and focuses on industrial quality control of packages.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:
   - Visit the dataset page: [Industrial Quality Control of Packages](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christianvorhemus/industrial-quality-control-of-packages)
   - Download the dataset files.

2. Unzip the dataset files and place them in the `archive` directory within the project folder. The directory structure should look like this:
   

## Running the Notebooks
1. Open and run the notebooks to execute the code and build the classification model.

## Notes
- Ensure that the dataset is properly structured and accessible within the `archive` directory.
- Modify the paths in the notebooks if necessary to match your local directory structure.
